# Leaflet-Challenge

For this Challenege we were tasked with gathering GEOJSON data about earthuakes around the world, then using leaflet to map the locations of each earthquake with tags denoting the location, magnitude and depth.
once everything was maped we had to color code the grapgh to represent the depths of the earthquakes and make sure the bubbles demarkating the earthquakes varried in size in relation to the maginitude of the earthqaukes.

I used the datasetof all earthquakes that had happened in the past 7 days around the world.
