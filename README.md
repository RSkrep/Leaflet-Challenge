# Leaflet-Challenge

For this Challenege we were tasked with gathering GEOJSON data about earthuakes around the world, then using leaflet to map the locations of each earthquake with tags denoting the location, magnitude and depth.
once everything was maped we had to color code the grapgh to represent the depths of the earthquakes and make sure the bubbles demarkating the earthquakes varried in size in relation to the maginitude of the earthqaukes.

I used the datasetof all earthquakes that had happened in the past 7 days around the world.

Completion process I would first attempt to find each of these values using my memory, then I would look into the class notes and activities as a way to find out my next course of action when I was lost. After doing these steps I would consult ChatGPT to find out where I went wrong and would use its assistance to correct the code as well as explain its process to me so I could understand for the future how to fulfill these tasks without aid.
